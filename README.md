# Stage 1 Curriculum Project

This gitbook project is the first attempt of creating a curriculum for clinicians who want to move into the Health Tech space. The basic idea is to provide a structured learning path for clinicians who want to learn the basics of software development. 

This project is a work in progress and will be updated regularly.

# Running the project
