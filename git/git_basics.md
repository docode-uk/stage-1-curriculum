# Introduction to Git

## Overview
Git is currently the most popular **version control system** in the world, which involves recording the changes made to files over time in a type of **database** called a **repository**. It is completely free and open source. It enables collaboration between multiple contributors on projects, and ensures the entire history of files within a project are tracked and can be accessed.

It is a good idea to learn how to use Git early on in your coding journey, as it allows you to easily share code, collaborate with others on projects and access the entire version history of your code.

## Repositories

## Git vs GitHub

Git and GitHub are not the same

### Git

Git is a type of version control software which can be installed on your computer. It allows you to save your code as you go into a local git respository. Every time you use git to save the current state of your project, git takes a "snapshot" of what all your files within that project look like at that moment in time AND stores a reference to that snapshot (such that it is possible to REVERT code to that point in history). 

### GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based website which...
