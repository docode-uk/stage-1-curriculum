Create a key value store script accepts a key as the first argument, and maybe a value as the second argument. Think about how you would store the data using the techniques we have covered in this section to store and load the data. You need to handle the following operations:

- `set`: Set a key value pair
- `get`: Get a value by key
- `delete`: Delete a key value pair
